\section{Weakly-supervised segmentation}\label{sec:sup_segmentation}

In this section we provide more qualitative examples for weakly-supervised segmentation using \gcam{} as seed for SEC (\cite{seed_eccv16}).



The last row shows 2 failure cases. In the bottom left image, the clothes of the 2 person weren't highlighted correctly. This could be because the most discriminative parts are their faces, and hence \gcam{} maps only highlights those. This results in a segmentation that only highlights the faces of the 2 people. 
In the bottom right image, the bicycles, being extremely thin aren't highlighed. This could be because the resolution of the \gcam{} maps are low ($14 \times 14$) which makes it difficult to capture thin areas.
