\section{Qualitative comparison to Excitation Backprop (c-MWP) and CAM}\label{sec:sup_comparison}
\vspace{-5pt}
In this section we provide more qualitative results comparing \gcam{} with CAM~\cite{zhou_cvpr16} and c-MWP~\cite{zhang2016top} on Pascal~\cite{pascal-voc-2007}. %




We compare \gcam{}, CAM and c-MWP visualizations from ImageNet trained VGG-16 models finetuned on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.
While \gcam{} and c-MWP visualizations can be directly obtained from existing models, CAM requires an architectural change, and requires re-training, which leads to loss in accuracy.
Also, unlike \gcam{}, c-MWP and CAM can only be applied for image classification networks.
Visualizations for the ground-truth categories can be found in \reffig{fig:gcam_pascal}.
